C-s is I-search. The cursor jumps to next matching when you press C-s again.
If the cursor jump 3 matching down(e.g in line 100) then I want to keep my cursor in the current position(in line 100). I have to press ESC to cancel it. I'm wondering what is the shortcut key to cancel the I-search without using the ESC key?
